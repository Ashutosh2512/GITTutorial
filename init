git init command is used to initialize a local directory as a git repository.
So, switch to your directory open your terminal and execute the following command:
git init

Now, we have initialised our directory as a git repository but we don't have a remote repository linked to our local repo.In order to do so, we obtain the URL to our remote repo and type in the following command :
git remote add origin <URL_TO_REMOTE_REPO>

Example:
git remote add origin https://github.com/Ashutosh2512/GITTutorial
