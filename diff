Suppose, we want to compare our current branch with another branch,for the files and lines that have been added, deleted and modified. This can be done using the following command:
git diff <BRANCH_NAME_TO_COMPARE>

Example:
git diff checkout_demo_branch

Above command yields the following result as of now:


diff --git a/checkout b/checkout
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..c04aa3f
--- /dev/null
+++ b/checkout
@@ -0,0 +1,12 @@
+Following command is used to create a new branch:
+git checkout -b <NEW_BRANCH_NAME>
+
+We need a branch with the same name on the remote repository in order to make a push, else we will get refspec error:
+error: src refspec master does not match any.
+
+Following command is used to switch between branches:
+git checkout <NEXT_BRANCH>
+
+Example:
+git checkout -b feature
+git checkout feature
diff --git a/checkout_demo_file b/checkout_demo_file
deleted file mode 100644
