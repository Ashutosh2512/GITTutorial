Push is used to update our remote git repo after all the tracked changes have been committed.
In order to do so, we need to know:
1. Remote repo location
2. Branch of the remote repo

Command:
git push origin master

origin-It points to our remote repository
master-It refers to the master branch of our repository. We can replace it with another branch name.
