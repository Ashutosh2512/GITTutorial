Below are some of the basic opeartions that we perform while using git. They are as follows:

Clone-  download a repository that is hosted somewhere on a remote repository.
Add-    track your files and canes made.
Commit- update your it with the changes made.
Push-   update git commits to a remote repo like Github.
Pull-   download changes made on your remote repo on your local machine.
Pull Request- It is created by a developer who has created a new branch and added some changes into the project to merge that branch with the main or master branch. So, why don't we directly work on master branch? The reason behind it is that the we only add well tested features of our product into the master branch so that it doesn't mess with the other features that have already been developed and our product doesn't malfunction.
Merge- When a pull request is created by a developer, then the owner of the repo must merge and resolve that pull request in order for the changes to be reflected into the main branch or another branch.
