Following command is used to create a new branch:
git checkout -b <NEW_BRANCH_NAME>

We need a branch with the same name on the remote repository in order to make a push, else we will get refspec error:
error: src refspec master does not match any.

Following command is used to switch between branches:
git checkout <NEXT_BRANCH>

Example:
git checkout -b feature
git checkout feature
